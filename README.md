# Ptol TIC80
 
PTOL is a retro-styled 2D take on Valve’s Portal, built using the TIC-80 fantasy console. Solve physics-based puzzles using a portal gun to teleport across levels, evade hazards, and outsmart obstacles. Featuring classic momentum tricks, switch puzzles, and a minimalist pixel-art aesthetic, PTOL delivers a nostalgic yet brain-bending experience.
